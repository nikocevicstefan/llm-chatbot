# Security Audit Report - LLM Chatbot

**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Auditor:** Security Review  
**Project:** LLM Chatbot (Multi-platform AI Bot)

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified **12 critical and high-severity vulnerabilities** in the LLM chatbot project. The most critical issues include hardcoded credentials, information disclosure, missing authentication, and inadequate input validation. Immediate action is required to address these vulnerabilities before production deployment.

## Critical Vulnerabilities (Severity: ðŸ”´ Critical)

### 1. Hardcoded Database Credentials
**File:** `docker-compose.yml:8`, `knexfile.js:11,33,55`, `.env.example:12`  
**Issue:** Default PostgreSQL password "password" is hardcoded across multiple configuration files.  
**Risk:** Database compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive conversation data.  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)

### 2. Exposed Database Admin Interface
**File:** `docker-compose.yml:35-47`  
**Issue:** Adminer database admin interface exposed on port 8080 without authentication.  
**Risk:** Complete database access, data manipulation, credential extraction.  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)

### 3. Information Disclosure in Health Endpoints
**File:** `src/routes/webhooks.ts:214-240`  
**Issue:** `/webhook/health` endpoint exposes sensitive configuration details including API key presence, service availability, and internal architecture.  
**Risk:** Information gathering for attackers, service enumeration.  
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)

## High Severity Vulnerabilities (Severity: ðŸŸ  High)

### 4. Weak Telegram Webhook Security
**File:** `src/utils/webhook-verification.ts:14-17`  
**Issue:** Telegram webhook verification allows requests without signature when no hash is provided.  
**Risk:** Message injection, unauthorized bot interactions, potential DoS.  
**CVSS Score:** 7.3 (High)

### 5. Missing Rate Limiting Implementation
**File:** `src/server.ts`  
**Issue:** No rate limiting implemented despite configuration variables in `.env.example`.  
**Risk:** DoS attacks, resource exhaustion, API abuse.  
**CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)

### 6. Excessive Request Size Limits
**File:** `src/server.ts:27`  
**Issue:** JSON body parser allows up to 10MB requests, far exceeding webhook needs.  
**Risk:** DoS attacks, memory exhaustion, application crashes.  
**CVSS Score:** 6.8 (High)

### 7. Error Information Disclosure
**File:** `src/server.ts:103-105`  
**Issue:** Error messages expose sensitive internal details in non-production environments.  
**Risk:** Information disclosure, debugging data exposure.  
**CVSS Score:** 6.2 (High)

## Medium Severity Vulnerabilities (Severity: ðŸŸ¡ Medium)

### 8. Missing SSL/TLS in Redis Configuration
**File:** `src/config/redis.ts`  
**Issue:** Redis connections lack SSL/TLS configuration for production environments.  
**Risk:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks on Redis communications.  
**CVSS Score:** 5.9 (Medium)

### 9. Insufficient Database Connection Security
**File:** `knexfile.js`  
**Issue:** No SSL configuration for PostgreSQL connections in production.  
**Risk:** Database traffic interception, credential exposure.  
**CVSS Score:** 5.7 (Medium)

### 10. Missing Security Headers
**File:** `src/server.ts:16`  
**Issue:** Helmet is used but without custom configuration for API-specific security headers.  
**Risk:** Various web-based attacks, XSS, clickjacking.  
**CVSS Score:** 5.4 (Medium)

## Low Severity Issues (Severity: ðŸŸ¢ Low)

### 11. Logging Security Concerns
**File:** Multiple files  
**Issue:** Extensive logging may inadvertently capture sensitive data from messages or tokens.  
**Risk:** Information disclosure through logs.  
**CVSS Score:** 4.3 (Low)

### 12. Missing Container Security
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`  
**Issue:** No security context, resource limits, or non-root user configuration.  
**Risk:** Container escape, resource exhaustion.  
**CVSS Score:** 4.1 (Low)

## Positive Security Findings âœ…

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**: Proper HMAC verification implemented for Slack webhooks
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas used for webhook data validation
3. **Raw Body Handling**: Secure raw body capture with size limits and timeouts
4. **CORS Protection**: CORS middleware properly configured
5. **Database Abstraction**: Knex.js used preventing direct SQL injection in most cases
6. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration externalized to environment variables

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Actions (Critical - Fix within 24 hours)
1. **Change all default passwords** in production configurations
2. **Remove or secure Adminer interface** - add authentication or disable in production
3. **Sanitize health endpoints** - remove sensitive configuration exposure
4. **Implement proper rate limiting** across all endpoints

### Short Term (High - Fix within 1 week)
5. **Strengthen webhook security** - require signatures for all webhook platforms
6. **Reduce request size limits** to reasonable values (1MB max for webhooks)
7. **Implement comprehensive error handling** without information disclosure
8. **Add SSL/TLS configuration** for all database and Redis connections

### Medium Term (Medium - Fix within 1 month)
9. **Enhance container security** with non-root users and resource limits
10. **Review and sanitize logging** to prevent sensitive data exposure
11. **Implement comprehensive security headers** with Helmet configuration
12. **Add security monitoring and alerting** for unusual patterns

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Conversation data storage requires proper encryption and access controls
- **SOC 2**: Lacks sufficient logging, monitoring, and access controls for compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: Vulnerable to A01 (Broken Access Control), A03 (Injection), A05 (Security Misconfiguration)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct external security assessment
2. **SAST/DAST**: Implement static and dynamic application security testing
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of npm packages
4. **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images
5. **Infrastructure Testing**: Security assessment of deployment environment

## Conclusion

The LLM chatbot project has significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment. The combination of hardcoded credentials, exposed administrative interfaces, and insufficient access controls creates a high-risk environment. Immediate remediation of critical and high-severity issues is essential.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Address all critical vulnerabilities immediately
2. Implement the provided security fixes
3. Conduct security testing after remediation
4. Establish ongoing security monitoring and maintenance procedures
